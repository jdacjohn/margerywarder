							<p class="p1-about"><a href="<?php print($siteRoot); ?>">Margery Kisby Warder</a> is a Christian Author/Speaker
              who enjoys opportunities to weave together faith and humor. One favorite Bible verse, Ezra 7:10, summarizes her
              mission: to prepare her heart to study God's Word, to actively apply God's Word within her own life, and finally,
              to teach God's truths through opportunities that arise.<br />
              Most of her adult life, Margery's focus and schedule centered on her privileges and joys as a Christ-follower,
              the wife of her pastor/husband, and their children's mother. Although only Jesus Christ lived an earthly life
              perfectly, her desire remains to be as obedient to Him as she understands that to be. Earlier that meant
              sometimes working outside the home, including teaching students publicly and in church settings, and volunteering
              in church and community activities. She is a strong supporter of those who devote their lives and alter their 
              careers to nurturing children. She, too, had to help her family live simply, but rejoices over many instances of
              seeing God demonstrate His awareness of their situations.  She loves being with family and remembers her most
              creative years were spent caring for her little ones.<br />
              Now that her husband is retired and their children are busy with families and ministries of their own, Margery 
              devotes more time to writing and to participating in a variety of events within area churches and community. 
              As an author, she seeks to edify or to be a missionary to the reading world.</p>

              <h3>The Author</h3>
              <p class='p3'>
								While living in Iowa, and turning 60 years young, Margery Kisby Warder cut her excuses for putting off writing by 
                quitting her best paying job. She joined Christian Writers Guild and began having her articles featured in local 
                newspapers. Margery then started writing her first historical fiction novel called 
                <a href="<?php print($siteRoot); ?>/books/#leaves">"Leaves That Did Not Wither"</a> and has since completed other
                books. Margery tries to balance her writing schedule with the rest of her life, but her computer could testify that there
                are usually a couple novels in process at any given time.
