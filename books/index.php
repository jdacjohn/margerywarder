                  	What can separate you from God's love? Can wealth? Poverty? Queen Victoria's despised Canning Town? Can
                    life? Death? Shattered dreams? The bottomless Atlantic or a failing farm in a strange land? War? Malicious
                    gossip? The Kisbey's 19th century lives provided frequent tests of their faith and character. The author's
                    "Novel Approach to Bible Study" offers opportunities for readers to dig into God's Word to stretch and 
                    cherish their lives, too.<br />
      							Unto All Generations follows Emanuel and Esther from England to Michigan in time for the "un-Civil" War. If
                    Emanuel enlists with Michigan's Calvary to meet farm debts and take a mouth from the table, can Londoner
                    Esther tend family and farm while waiting for her beloved's return? His letters home are woven into "Unto
                    All Generations." Their lives unfold with quaintness, humor, history, and a good dose of storytelling,
                    creating a tale perhaps not unlike many who ventured throught he nineteenth century, or even similar to 
                    circumstances families face today.<br />
      							Unto All Generations is the revision of Leaves That Did Not Wither (2009), but now separates each chapter
                    with an optional in-depth Bible study entitled "Holding onto Faith and Humor When God Dismantles Our
                    Comfort Zones." Those dealing with imperfect lives may find it appropriate for individual or group study.<br />
      							Margery Kisby Warder grew up near the farm where Esther spent her last years. Margery creatively spent her
                    adult life teaching Bible and assisting in her husband's ministry, raising their children, and occasionally
                    finding other ways to feed her passion for storytelling. When her children were almost grown, she held Esther's
                    letters in her hand and knew this novel needed to be written. To see her other writing visit

                  <p class="p2">
                  	If you hate humor and history, if you have a perfect family, if everyone you know always treats others 
                    with total respect, if you've never had a selfish thought settle into your head, then you probably ought
                    to go searching for another book.<br />
      							If, however, you like adventure and surprising twists in a story, if you ever wondered what might have 
                    happened if you'd acted on some of your "early" ideas, if you like a "feel good" story, then you might 
                    just devour "Elizabeth's Prodigal."<br />
      							In 1875, Margery Warder's grandfather ran off at age 13, probably taking little more than an overly 
                    confident estimate of his wisdom and a hefty chip on his shoulder. Little is known of his adventures 
                    until he shows up on a census a few states away in 1880. Margery's first novel relied upon family 
                    history and official documents to tell of her Great-grandparents' lives, but in "Elizabeth's Prodigal," 
                    it's the next generation's turn to tell a story, and fiction rules.<br />
      							The headstrong runaway in "Elizabeth's Prodigal" is not Alfred, the author's grandfather. Fictitious 
                    Albert, however, plans to cast off just about everything that matters to those who care about him. His 
                    antics take him into adventure, conflict, grandiose plans for success, trickery, opportunities to gain 
                    wisdom, and before the book closes, even a bit of romance. Will Elizabeth's prodigal pick up truths 
                    along the way?<br />
    								Some will choose this book as a "family read." Older youth and adults may like that it's an entertaining
                    transport back to 1875. Many will spot an insight along the way or a discussion question at the end of 
                    the book that will stay with them for a long time.<br />
     								Softcover version story has approximately 384 pages; eReaders vary. Includes about a dozen discussion 
                    questions at the end.

                  This collection of inspirational short stories, devotional thoughts, essays, and poetry, often weaves 
                  truth and humor into a book that’s perfect for the Christmas season, or for those who want to keep 
                  Christmas all year long.  Some writings are humorous, some nostalgic and old-fashioned. Some look back to 
                  Christmas on the farm, while others offer insights about Christmas today. The timelessness of the 
                  Christmas story are found in this 'homey' book about Christmas. There’s even a simple three-character 
                  skit (Mary, Joseph, Shepherd) that could become part of a December get-together, and a short story about 
                  newlyweds wanting to start their own tradition but missing their families. If this collection pleases you 
                  with its approximately 100 pages, you will want to know they are included in a larger book entitled, 
                  “Christmas Musings” (approximately 225 pages). “Christmas Musings” is composed of “Christmas in Our Hearts,
                  ” “Last Christmas,” and “Mary, Meet Dr. Luke.” (Please see fuller descriptions and testimonials for those 
                  book/eBooks below.)

                  <p class="p2">"Christmas Musings" is a softcover Christmas collection of short stories, humorous and inspirational messages, and 
                  poetry/prose. This "Three in One" book's contents work nicely together as a 226 page book with three divisions. 
                  Please note, those three divisions within "Christmas Musings" can also be purchased individually online as three 
                  eBooks 
                  ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Hearts-Margery-Kisby-Warder-ebook/dp/B00GNJ4M1A" target="_blank">Christmas in Our Hearts</a>", 
                  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Christmas-Margery-Kisby-Warder-ebook/dp/B00GOF9DDK" target="_blank">Last Christmas</a>",

                  "Christmas Musings" is perfect for the Christmas season... or for anyone who likes to keep the spirit of Christmas
                  throughout the year. <em>"Christmas in Our Hearts" is a collection of short stories, prose/poetry, devotional
                  thoughts, mixing truth and humor. In "Last Christmas," an overworked Tom is trading the love he had for Carol and
                  the children for the love he has for work... They go to Maine for Christmas, but his heart is in Houston.. until he
                  has an "encounter" that offers him he's not sure about the wisdon of resisting... Readers are invited to contemplate
                  what a conversation between Mary and the author of Luke's gospel might have been like in "Mary, Meet Dr. Luke."
                  Mary tells the physician about the events of that first Christmas night in Bethlehem, and what it was like to witness
                  the events of Jesus' life, including the crucifixion. All of the eBooks ("Christmas in Our Hearts", "Mary, Meet Dr. Luke",
                  and "Last Christmas") are in the larger "Christmas Musings" which is available as an eBook or softcover on Amazon.</p>

                            "Heartwarming, nostalgic and sentimental. A breath of pure pleasure for a culture that has forgotten what 
                            Christmas is all about. Reminders of family and community traditions in the mid 1900s--the caring, concern and 
                            compassion directed toward one another and others--before "fear of offending" by mentioning the name, Jesus. 
                            Will make you laugh, cry and think. "Oh, what fun" to remember how Christmas use to be celebrated. No language

                            really shaken up when he learns that his wife is dying. An encounter in the forest forces him 
                            to turn his life around - just in time. Thankfully God is a God of second chances.”

                  <p class="p2">What can separate us from God's love? Can wealth? Poverty? Queen Victoria's England? Can health or sickness? Can 
                  life? Death? The bottomless Atlantic? Life in a strange land? War? Maybe gossips? Nineteenth century England and 
                  America provided ample opportunities to test one's character and faith. Affluence and deceit put Esther and Emanuel 
                  into a carriage headed for London. They step out, grateful to go their separate ways. Still, Aunt Emma notices 
                  something about Emanuel that might be worth remembering. Foes threaten life regardless of where it's lived, but 
                  foes waiting for Esther and Emanuel in Canning Town seem to have bigger clubs. Dare the couple cross the Atlantic 
                  to join families in America? 1858 becomes the eve of America's Civil War. If the "un-civil" war continues, will it 
                  entangle Esther and Emanuel? Leaves That Did Not Wither is based upon research into the times and lives of Esther 
                  Copsey and Emanuel Kisbey. Esther kept Civil War letters for her descendents. Now one passes the letters on to you. 
                  Lives of unnoticed English Americans unfold with quaintness, humor, history and a good dose of storytelling into a 
                  tale perhaps not unlike circumstances of many who ventured into the nineteenth century.</p>
